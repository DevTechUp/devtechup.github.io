Proficient in regular expressions, so that your development efficiency can be greatly improved. Regular expressions are often used for field or any string validation, such as the following check the basic date format of the JavaScript code: 123var reg = /^(\\\\d&#123;1,4&#125;)(-|\\\\/)(\\\\d&#123;1,2&#125;)\\\\2(\\\\d&#123;1,2&#125;)$/; var r = fieldValue.match(reg); if(r==null)alert('Date format error!'); The following is front-end development often used to 20 regular expressions. 1. Verify password strengthThe strength of the password must be a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers, and can not use special characters, with lengths between 8 and 10. 1^(?=.*\\\\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).&#123;8,10&#125;$ 2. Verify ChineseThe string can only be Chinese1^[\\\\u4e00-\\\\u9fa5]&#123;0,&#125;$ 3. A string consisting of numbers, 26 letters or underscores1^\\\\w+$ 4. Verify the E-Mail address1[\\\\w!#$%&amp;&apos;*+/=?^_`&#123;|&#125;~-]+(?:\\\\.[\\\\w!#$%&amp;&apos;*+/=?^_`&#123;|&#125;~-]+)*@(?:[\\\\w](?:[\\\\w-]*[\\\\w])?\\\\.)+[\\\\w](?:[\\\\w-]*[\\\\w])? 5. Check the identity card numberThe following is a regular verification of the identity card number. 15 or 18 bits. 151^[1-9]\\\\d&#123;7&#125;((0\\\\d)|(1[0-2]))(([0|1|2]\\\\d)|3[0-1])\\\\d&#123;3&#125;$ 181^[1-9]\\\\d&#123;5&#125;[1-9]\\\\d&#123;3&#125;((0\\\\d)|(1[0-2]))(([0|1|2]\\\\d)|3[0-1])\\\\d&#123;3&#125;([0-9]|X)$ 6. Check date“yyyy-mm-dd” format date check, has been considered flat leap year. 1^(?:(?!0000)[0-9]&#123;4&#125;-(?:(?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(?:0[1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-8])|(?:0[13-9]|1[0-2])-(?:29|30)|(?:0[13578]|1[02])-31)|(?:[0-9]&#123;2&#125;(?:0[48]|[2468][048]|[13579][26])|(?:0[48]|[2468][048]|[13579][26])00)-02-29)$ 7. Check the amountCheck the amount, accurate to 2 decimal places. 1^[0-9]+(.[0-9]&#123;2&#125;)?$ 8. Check the phone numberThe following is the domestic 13,15,18 at the beginning of the mobile phone number regular expression. (According to the current domestic collection number to expand the first two numbers) 1^(13[0-9]|14[5|7]|15[0|1|2|3|5|6|7|8|9]|18[0|1|2|3|5|6|7|8|9])\\\\d&#123;8&#125;$ 9. Determine the version of IEIE has not been completely replaced, a lot of pages or need to do version compatibility, the following is the IE version of the check expression.1^.*MSIE [5-8](?:\\\\.[0-9]+)?(?!.*Trident\\\\/[5-9]\\\\.0).*$ 10. Verify IP-v4 addressIP4 regular statement.1\\\\b(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\\\\.)&#123;3&#125;(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\\\\b 11.

PhabricatorThe first codereview tool, of course, is not limited to codereview, this tool I experienced the next, the function is very powerful. In addition to codereview, there are tasks, bug management, wiki management, project management and other functions, but also custom features, the interface is also very refreshing. Personally feel that there is almost nothing to picky place, if just need a set of tools with each other team, choose this is wrong. (If it is me, I am more inclined to this tool) Experience Phabricator ReviewNinjaJust began to experience this tool, purely because of curiosity, was attracted to the name: English Japanese pronunciation, plus I was a fire fan … … experience after feeling really good. This tool is very lightweight, and only supports github, it is suitable for individuals, small teams to use. Focus on the codereview this function, the interface is also very refreshing, you can through some special comment symbols to github merge button to produce changes in response, but also change the github pr checks. If my scene is only github, then i would choose to use this tool, access is also very simple, open source free. CodacyThis tool is a bit like Phabricator, but this tool has the code quality statistics and suggestions, there are analysis, codereview function is also very full, there dashboard can list the various indicators of the project, very praise, the key is that this tool can dock github, bitbucket , Jira and Jenkins, but also docking hipchat and slack, etc., the function is very powerful, it is worth a good look. Personally feel that this tool is very broad scope of application, some of the quality of the project is not only limited to codereview can try to use a github on the public warehouse is free. Features Codacy experience RhodeCodeSupport git, svn, multi-warehouse management, interface experience is also relatively refreshing, features and codacy have a lot of overlap. RhodeCode Features Demo GerritThis is Google open source codereview tool, and Phabricator go hand in hand, but also very strong, but I personally do not like this interface style … … I do not have to go through this, just read some of the official website information, function does not lose Phabricator.
